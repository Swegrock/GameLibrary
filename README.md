# Petit

While working on a small game for a uni project, I realised I had nothing I could use to prototype games quickly and effectively. So using the game I was making as a basis, I spent two days writing Petit.
Petit is a collection of simple classes written to help you prototype a game in minutes.

Petit features:

 - Simple collision detection
 - Basic physics implementation
 - Basic spritesheet implementation
 - Following camera

Next up:
- Collision depth
